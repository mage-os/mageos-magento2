# Magento_CheckoutAgreements module

This module provides the ability to add web store agreements that customers must accept before purchasing products from the store.
The customer will need to accept the terms and conditions in the Order Review section of the checkout process to be able to place an order if Terms and Conditions functionality is enabled.
