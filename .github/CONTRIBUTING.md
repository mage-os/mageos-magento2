# Contributing to Magento 2 code

Contributions to the Mage-OS Magento 2 codebase are done using the fork & pull model.
This contribution model has contributors maintaining their own fork of the Mage-OS Magento 2 repository.
The forked repository is then used to submit a request to the base repository to "pull" a set of changes.
For more information on pull requests please refer to [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

Contributions can take the form of new components or features, changes to existing features, tests, documentation (such as developer guides, user guides, examples, or specifications), bug fixes or optimizations.

The Mage-OS Magento 2 development team or community maintainers will review all issues and contributions submitted by the community of developers in the first in, first out order.
During the review we might require clarifications from the contributor.
If there is no response from the contributor within two weeks, the pull request will be closed.

For more detailed information on contribution please read our [beginners guide](https://github.com/magento/magento2/wiki/Getting-Started).

## Contribution requirements

1. Contributions must adhere to the [Magento coding standards](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/php/coding-standards/).
2. Pull requests (PRs) must be accompanied by a meaningful description of their purpose. Comprehensive descriptions increase the chances of a pull request being merged quickly and without additional clarification requests.
3. Commits must be accompanied by meaningful commit messages. Please see the [Mage-OS Magento Pull Request Template](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/blob/HEAD/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) for more information.
4. PRs which include bug fixes must be accompanied with a step-by-step description of how to reproduce the bug.
5. PRs which include new logic or new features must be submitted along with:
   * Unit/integration test coverage
   * Proposed [documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce) updates. Use feedback buttons __Edit in GitHub__ and __Log an issue__ at the top of a relevant topic.
6. For larger features or changes, please [open an issue](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/issues) to discuss the proposed changes prior to development. This may prevent duplicate or unnecessary effort and allow other contributors to provide input.
7. All automated tests must pass.
