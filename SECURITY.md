# Reporting Security Issues

We value the contributions of the security research community, and we look forward to working with you to minimize risk to Magento merchants.

## For any issues specific to Mage-OS or a Mage-OS Lab module:

We do not currently have a paid bug bounty program for Mage-OS. Please report any issues to our security team at: `security@mage-os.org`

## For any issues that also apply to Magento Open Source:

Adobe runs a paid bug bounty program for Magento Open Source and Adobe Commerce. Please report any issues common to Mage-OS and Magento there. Any issues that are reported and fixed through that program will be released as a security patch for Magento, and then incorporated into Mage-OS as soon as possible after.

### Where should I report security issues?

We strongly encourage you to report all security issues privately via our [bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/adobe).  Please provide us with relevant technical details and repro steps to expedite our investigation.  If you prefer not to use HackerOne, email us directly at `psirt@adobe.com` with details and repro steps.
